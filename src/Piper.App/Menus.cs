/// <summary>Builds menu items that show their accelerator in the shortcut column.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A tab in <see cref="ToolStripItem.Text"/> is a Win32 menu convention that
/// <see cref="ToolStripMenuItem"/> does not implement. It renders as nothing at all, so
/// "Resend request\tCtrl+R" reached the screen as "Resend requestCtrl+R" with the label and the
/// accelerator run together. WinForms wants the accelerator in
/// <see cref="ToolStripMenuItem.ShortcutKeyDisplayString"/>, which is laid out in its own
/// right-aligned column.
///
/// Display only: every accelerator these items advertise is handled by a <c>KeyDown</c> handler on
/// the control that owns it, which is why <see cref="ToolStripMenuItem.ShortcutKeys"/> stays unset
/// here. Setting it would register a form-wide accelerator and take the key away from the focused
/// control.
